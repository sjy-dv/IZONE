## _Fully Managed Kubernetes_
### A system aimed at providing complete management of all systems on Kubernetes.


IZONE is a project designed and developed to automatically and fully manage Kubernetes resources. Early-stage companies, not large teams, often lack infrastructure knowledge or find it challenging to manage Kubernetes. This project offers various services for these companies, such as automatically increasing or decreasing replicas, expanding PVCs, and monitoring Kubernetes resources for free, without any additional paid services, and receiving alerts on Slack.(We also have plans to set up a separate monitoring dashboard in the long term.)

Additionally, IZONE is planning to provide a high-level database monitoring system. This will enable developers to manage and scale their databases more easily and efficiently. Furthermore, IZONE aims to support automation of even these scaling processes in the future.


### **warning:** This project is in a very early stage. It lacks many supported features, and we don't know what errors may occur.
