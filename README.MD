## _Small Watcher of Fully Managed Kubernetes_

KSlack is a project designed and developed to automatically and fully manage Kubernetes resources. Early-stage companies, not large teams, often lack infrastructure knowledge or find it challenging to manage Kubernetes. This project offers various services for these companies, such as automatically increasing or decreasing replicas, expanding PVCs, and monitoring Kubernetes resources for free, without any additional paid services, and receiving alerts on Slack.
