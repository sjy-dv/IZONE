## _Small Watcher of Fully Managed Kubernetes_

IZONE is a project designed and developed to automatically and fully manage Kubernetes resources. Early-stage companies, not large teams, often lack infrastructure knowledge or find it challenging to manage Kubernetes. This project offers various services for these companies, such as automatically increasing or decreasing replicas, expanding PVCs, and monitoring Kubernetes resources for free, without any additional paid services, and receiving alerts on Slack.


### **warning:** This project is in a very early stage. It lacks many supported features, and we don't know what errors may occur.

When you start, you can receive notifications about log levels via Slack easily.

As an example, when using a stress tool, you can receive additional notifications based on the increase in metrics.
